# On Css Animations

A simple presentation & project demonstration on getting started with CSS Animations & Transitions

## Presentation

[Located Here](http://sapientnitrola.github.io/on-css-animation/#1)

This presentation breaks down animations into two entities: Effect & Act. This enables us to separate the different aspects of transformations in CSS, with the movement associated with Animations. The presentation is built in markdown and compiled visually with [MarkdownPresenter][presenter].

### Effect

The Effect covers *what* is being changed

+ CSS Properties
+ Transform
+ Keyframes

### Act

The Act covers *how* it is being changed

+ Transition
+ Animation
